# Beachwalk — context for Claude

A first-person low-poly horror walking sim: an eerie infinite night beach.
See `README.md` for the player-facing feature list and every tuning knob.

## Running it

```bash
python3 serve.py 4173      # dependency-free static server
```

Then open <http://localhost:4173>. It needs to be served over HTTP (ES
modules); `file://` won't work. `node`/`npx` are not assumed to be present.

## Stack

- Vanilla JS, no build step. `index.html` + `main.js` + `assets/` + vendored
  three.js r160 in `vendor/three/` (imported via the import map in the HTML).
- The **whole game is `main.js`** (~2000 lines, one file, top-to-bottom).
- `.claude/launch.json` lets the Claude Code browser preview start the server.

## Architecture — the load-bearing ideas

**World axes.** You walk **down the beach along -Z** toward the low moon
(`MOON_DIR`). The **ocean is toward -X** (your left); the dry beach is +X and
ends in a **sand cliff**. The player is a bare camera clamped between two
invisible walls: `WADE_X` (into the surf) and `CLIFF_BLOCK_X` (foot of the
cliff) — both are clamps on `camera.position.x`.

**"Infinite" = recentring tiles.** `sand`, `ocean`, the `debris` group and
`cliff` are large meshes snapped back onto the player every frame (sand/ocean
in X+Z, debris/cliff in Z only, to `DEBRIS_TILE` / `CLIFF_PERIOD`). Nothing
actually scrolls. All water/shoreline motion is computed in **world space**
in the shaders (`shoreLine(z,t)` in `shoreGLSL`), so recentring is invisible.
The `lighthouse` and the `castle` are the exceptions — fixed world objects.

**Shaders.** `noiseGLSL` / `shoreGLSL` / `waveGLSL` are string fragments
shared between the ocean `ShaderMaterial` and the sand material's
`onBeforeCompile`. The sand shader discards fragments seaward of `shoreLine`
so it never overlaps the water; the ocean discards fragments landward of it.

**Retro look.** `renderer.setPixelRatio(RETRO_SCALE)` (~0.42) renders at low
res; CSS `image-rendering: pixelated` blows it up. `retroTex()` forces
nearest filtering / no anisotropy. Canvas textures are small (256²) and
colour-quantised. Everything is `flatShading`.

**Pointer lock is hand-rolled** (not `PointerLockControls`, so we get
sensitivity + invert-Y). `requestLock()` + `pointerlockchange` +
one `mousemove` handler. There's a drag-to-look **fallback** for browsers
that can't lock. Key gotcha: browsers enforce a ~1.25 s cooldown before
re-locking after an exit, so re-locking right after closing the note/menu
fails — handled by `everLocked` / `scheduleLockRetry()`; never fall back to
drag-look once we've successfully locked once.

**Interaction.** `updateHover()` raycasts the screen centre against
`interactables[]` each frame. `addInteractable(root, label, kind, data)` —
`kind` is `'physics'` (grab), `'inventory'` (take), or default (`data.onActivate`).
Tiny props carry an invisible `hitProxy` sphere so they're easy to aim at.
`primaryAction()` (click / `E` / `F`) routes grab / throw / take / dig.

**Examine view.** `openInspect(model)` / `closeInspect()` — a "turn the item
over" screen (like the RE inventory). `inspectScene` + `inspectCamera` render
over everything when `inspecting` (animate() early-returns); `inspectFit`
centres+scales the model, `inspectPivot` is spun by dragging `#inspect`.
`frozen()` includes `inspecting`. Used by the crab (`openInspect(crab)`) and
the syringe; reusable for any examinable item.

**The extraction / combine.** Crab + syringe are separate inventory items;
"use" *either* while carrying the other → `startExtraction()`. A scripted
sequence plays in the inspect scene: an `extractRig` holds crab + syringe with
the needle at `_hinge`, and `driveExtraction(t)` (from `updateInspect`, ~3.4 s)
pops the cap, sinks the needle, runs `syringe.userData.setFill(0→1)`, then
lifts out. `finishExtraction()` sets `crabBled`, empties + re-caps the syringe,
adds a **"Jar of blue blood"** item (`makeBloodJar()`), and shows the jar as
the payoff.

**Object models.** `models/` holds standalone factories (`makeHorseshoeCrab()`,
`makeSyringe()`, `makeBloodJar()`) plus `viewer.html` (`?model=…`), a
drag-to-rotate dev viewer. Factories `import * as THREE from 'three'`, return a
`Group`, use metres, `+Y` up / `+Z` forward. **Smooth-shaded**, a deliberate
exception to the flat-shaded retro look because they're hero props seen up
close. The syringe and jar carry `userData.setFill(t)` + `userData.parts`.

**The drainage tunnel home.** `models/drainage-tunnel-home.js` →
`makeDrainageTunnelHome()`, placed at
`DRAIN_X` (= `CLIFF_BLOCK_X`) / `DRAIN_Z` — behind you when you spawn. Not to
be confused with the **tunnel in the sand wall** (`tunnel`, `insideTunnel`,
`TUN_*`, `updateTunnelBounds()`), a separate dug corridor further down the
walk; the two are independent and their identifiers do not overlap. This one
is a **fixed world object** like the lighthouse, and three things make it work:

- The cliff is *cut open* at the mouth by a **world-space discard** injected
  into `cliff.material.onBeforeCompile` — world space, because the cliff is
  snapped back onto the player in Z every frame and a local-space window would
  slide with it. Same reasoning as `shoreLine(z,t)`.
- The headwall is a **shell, not a solid** — an open-ended cylinder plus a
  `RingGeometry` face plate with the bore hole in it. A solid block would plug
  the pipe.
- `updateDrain(dt)` runs **after** `updateTower(dt)` so it gets the last word on
  `groundY`, and `insideDrain` lifts the `CLIFF_BLOCK_X` clamp. Gotcha: the
  chamber's back wall must be clamped *inside* the `insideDrain` branch —
  letting the player fall out of that branch drops `insideDrain`, and the cliff
  clamp then teleports them back to the mouth.

Two more traps, both of which bit once already:

- **A wall with a doorway in it is four slabs around the hole.** Adding a
  full-width slab "for the wall" as well plugs the opening — the collision
  still lets you walk through, so it only shows up visually.
- **A group rotated to face a wall has its own +Z.** For the back-wall outlet
  (`F.rotation.y = -PI/2`) local +Z points *into the room*, so anything set
  into the wall needs a **negative** z or the pipe sticks out of it.
- **A fixture on the pipe wall must have +Y pointing radially outward.** For a
  thing at angle `ang` from the crown on side `sg`, that is
  `rotation.x = sg * ang` — nothing else. Get it wrong and the fixture, and
  especially anything long attached to it like a conduit, swings out into the
  middle of the bore and reads as a random pipe crossing the tunnel. The wall
  lamps and the side connection both had this.
- **A wall a doorway sits in has to span the *room*, not the pipe.** The door
  bulkhead was 5 m wide against a 6.8 m room, leaving an open gap at each front
  corner that you could see the sky through.
- **A dark ring on a solid wall is not a hole.** The back wall is built as four
  slabs around a real opening, with a closed dark box behind it, so the outlet
  bore actually recedes into somewhere.

Solid furniture is `userData.nav.props` — local-space `[x0, z0, x1, z1]`
AABBs that `pushOutOfDrainProps()` shoves the player out of along the
shallowest face.

**Turning round used to hitch for a quarter second.** The structure is
frustum-culled until it first enters the view, and that frame pays for
compiling every shader program *and* uploading ~400 geometries.
`renderer.compile()` only does the programs, so `warmDrain()` renders the
whole thing into an 8×8 offscreen target on the first animate frame, while
the title card still covers the screen; and `bakeScatter()` merges the
decorative scatter by material (`BufferGeometryUtils.mergeGeometries`,
now in the import map). 263 ms → ~36 ms. `bakeScatter` has to normalise
first — polyhedra come out non-indexed, boxes indexed, and the hand-built
channel strips carry no uv, and the merge refuses a mixed batch.

**Flicker is always coplanar faces.** The two that bit: the door frame's
back face sat exactly on the wall's front face, and the threshold slab's
top was exactly level with both the bore invert and the room floor.

**The crosshair can thread a grille.** The back-wall outlet needs an
invisible `hitProxy` disc across the bore, or the centre ray passes between
the bars and straight down the open pipe. Its interactable is `bare: true`,
which prints the label with no `[E]` prefix — it's a statement, not an
action.

The **erosion channel** outside can only ever sit *above* y = 0 — the beach
sand is a flat plane recentred on the player, so a trench cut below it would
just be covered over. The depth reads from the berms heaped either side, and
those are squashed icosahedra using **the beach's own `sandMat`** (passed in
via `makeDrainTunnel({ sandMat, wetSandMat })`) — boxes in a bespoke colour
read as pale slabs dropped on the sand, which is exactly what it looked like
first time round.

Ambience is synthesised in `startDrainAudio()` / `sfxDrip()` and ramped by
`drainMix` (how deep you are), which also ducks `waveBusGain` so the surf falls
away behind you; `mouthNear` drives a separate trickle layer at the outfall.
`updateDrainDrips()` drops visible droplets and fires `sfxDrip()` — panned by
where the drop is relative to your view — at the moment one lands. Note
`exponentialRampToValueAtTime` throws on a zero target, so the drip gain is
guarded: `drainMix` can reach 0 while a drop is still falling.

A full **bottle of water** (`models/water-bottle.js`) sits by the bed —
`waterBottleItem`, takeable with `E`, examinable like the crab. It is not
wired to `hp`; making it a consumable would just need `use` to call a heal.

**The wreck.** `models/shipwreck.js` → `makeShipwreck()`, the **Limulus** — an
old horseshoe-crabbing boat, which is why her gear is aboard and why the catch
is still in the hold. She lies across the beach at `SHIP_X` / `SHIP_Z` and
blocks the walk; you get past it by going through it.

The hull is a loft with `beamAt` (fined stem, rounded transom), `flareAt` (bow
flare), `rakeAt` (the stem leans forward as it rises) and **`sheerAt`** (the
deck line lifts to both ends). Sheer is the one that stops a hull reading as a
shoebox — and because the plating follows it, `shipFloorAt()` has to as well
via `deckYAt(lx)`, or you float over the bow and sink at midships. Collision is a **floor lookup**, not a solid: `shipFloorAt(lx, lz,
feet)` returns the highest walkable surface at or just below your feet, so the
hold floor and the deck can sit at the same (x, z) without fighting — the deck
is only selectable once the stair has actually lifted you. Anywhere inside the
hull with no floor is solid and pushes you back out.

Two things that had to be got right, both found by walking it:

- **Which lateral clamp applies is decided by *where* you are, not by how high
  the floor is.** Keying the hold's walls off "below deck level" made them
  apply to the exit ramp too, and they shoved you back up it every time.
- **Holes in the deck must not sit across the route.** The stair well was
  originally on the far side, which left a 0.4 m ledge between it and the
  bulwark — not a path. The stair is now on the side you come in, so climbing
  it leaves you on open deck with a clear run to the ramp.

The **ship's wheel** (`shipWheel`) has three detents; `shipWheel.position` is
−1 / 0 / +1 and the hover label carries the state. Nothing reads it yet — it's
there for a puzzle.

**Physics.** `PhysProp` class + `physProps[]` — a tiny custom rigid body
(gravity, ground bounce/friction, corridor walls; **no prop-vs-prop
collision**). Grab springs the held prop in front of the camera; click again
throws; `G` drops.

**First-person hand.** Rendered in a **separate overlay scene**
(`vmScene` / `vmCamera`, `renderer.autoClear=false; clearDepth()`).
`armRig` = a bare skin-toned hand/forearm; `toolMount` at the fist centre
holds tool models (the shovel). `layoutViewmodel()` positions the hand from
the view camera's half-extents so it stays framed at any window aspect —
call it on resize. The dig swing is driven by `digT` (0→1 over `DIG_DUR`)
in `updateViewmodel()`; the impact fires at the halfway point.

**Digging.** `crosshairGroundPoint()` raycasts the crosshair onto `sand`.
`digImpact()` stamps `digHoles` (flat crater decal) + `digPits` (sunk 3D
cone) + `digMounds` (spoil), spawns `spawnPuffs()` sand chunks, and plays
`sfxDigImpact()`. Pools recycle after `DIG_POOL` (20).

**Audio** is all synthesised in `startAmbientAudio()` / `sfx*()` (wind, surf,
footsteps, dig, glass). The **one sample** is `assets/backrooms.m4a` — the
opening music, faded in/out via a Web Audio gain chain in `startMusic()`
(`MUSIC_*` consts), started when the intro ends.

**Opening.** Title card is bare "BEACHWALK" + controls. `beginGame()` (on
the overlay click) requests pointer lock *on the gesture*, then runs the
black `#intro` card: the line fades in, holds, fades out, world fades up,
`introDone = true`, music starts. `frozen()` includes `!introDone`.

## Working in the Claude Code browser preview

The preview browser can't use the real Pointer Lock API and **throttles
`requestAnimationFrame` when its pane isn't focused**, so live movement is
hard to drive from `javascript_tool`. Instead:

- `window.__bw` exposes `scene`, `camera`, `state()`, `music()`, and helpers
  like `startDig`, `spawnPuffs`, `toggleEquip`, `beginGame`, `showEnd`,
  `openInspect`/`closeInspect`, `startExtraction`, `crab`, `syringe`,
  `bloodJar`, `crabItem`, `syringeItem`, `jarItem`.
- Move the camera by hand (`camera.position.set(...)` + `camera.lookAt(...)`
  + `camera.updateMatrixWorld(true)`), then take a screenshot to force one
  render frame.

## Gotchas worth knowing

**A new `three/addons/…` import needs adding to TWO import maps.** There is no
build step, so `three/addons/utils/BufferGeometryUtils.js` is a bare specifier —
a nickname the browser will not guess at. It only resolves if it is listed in
the import map, and there are two of them: `index.html` for the game and
`models/viewer.html` for the dev viewer. Miss either and that page dies with
`Failed to resolve module specifier …` before a single line runs — a blank
screen, not a degraded one. Being present in `vendor/three/` is not enough:
`BufferGeometryUtils.js` sat there unreferenced for ages and still had to be
mapped the first time something imported it.

**Declaration order matters.** `main.js` is one long top-to-bottom module of
`const`s, so anything that *calls* `addInteractable` or pushes to a shared
array must appear **after** that array is declared, or you get a temporal
dead zone error at load. The lighthouse door and the pickup-shine helper both
had to be moved for this reason.

**All one-shot sfx go through `sfxOut()`**, which returns the SFX bus. Never
`connect(ctx.destination)` from an effect — that bypasses both the Effects
volume slider and the master volume, which is how digging ended up deafening.
Music is the deliberate exception.

**The lighthouse is generated, not imported.** Two profile functions at the
top of `main.js` define it and everything else is hung off them: `lhOuterAt(y)`
is the outer face (a splayed base course, then a concave taper r4.35 → r2.45
at `LH_TOP`) and `lhBoreAt(y)` is the clear inside (r2.55 → r1.90). The shaft
is two `LatheGeometry` revolutions of those profiles; the gallery, lantern
room and roof sit on top of them. If you move a wall, move the profile — do
not hand-place a radius, or the deck and the stair will drift off it again.

A scanned tower (jonnysniper41's) used to stand here and was dropped in
Sep 2026. It was a closed 20-sided post with no lantern and no openings, so
every added part had to be guessed against a shape we didn't control, and the
door, the corbel and the lantern floor each ended up slightly wrong. Building
it made all three exact. Don't reintroduce a scan for the tower.

**Openings are cut, not modelled.** `OPENINGS` lists the door and the four
stair windows in the *game's* angle convention (`atan2(x, z)`, measured from
+Z — the same one `updateTower()` measures the player in), and `carve()` drops
the triangles whose centroid falls inside one. Note the lathe rings are seeded
on every opening edge so the cuts come out square. Window angles are stored in
the cos/sin convention on `lhWindows`, hence the `Math.PI / 2 - w.ang` when
they cross over; get that backwards and the holes appear on the wrong side.

**The wall is thick.** 1.9 m at the foot, 0.55 m under the lantern, so every
hole needs a lined reveal (jambs, soffit, sill) or you see straight through
the cut edge. The door additionally has a projecting stone surround outside.

**Beach rocks are world objects, not debris.** `makeErodedRock()` builds them
(lobes for the silhouette, hard-cut solution pits for the surface, a shear
plane for the wave-cut face, flattened base) and they're placed as *formations*
— 4-7 masses round a shared centre, 90-170 m apart. They deliberately sit
outside the recentring `debris` tile and outside `clipAtShore()`: they're
landmarks you can climb, and a real rock stays visible when the tide runs over
it. `rockColliders[]` gives each mass a cylinder — `rockGroundAt()` to stand on
it, `pushOutOfRocks()` to keep you out of it — applied in `update()` after
`updateTower()`, so a rock beats the sand.

**The tunnel is region-clamped, not collided.** The cliff is one mesh that
snaps back onto the player every `CLIFF_PERIOD`, so a hole cut in it would
repeat down the whole beach. Instead the bore stands proud of the dune toe at
`TUN_BORE_X`, the cliff material discards fragments across the mouth in WORLD
space (same trick as `clipAtShore`), and `updateTunnelBounds()` clamps you to a
box for the corridor and a bigger box for the room. `inTunnelMouth()` is what
lifts `CLIFF_BLOCK_X`, and only down low. The room at the end is a stand-in,
not the reference model.

**The shovel has two swings.** Left click is the plain dig; holding right winds
up (`startWind`/`releaseWind`, `WIND_FULL`) and `digPower` 0-1 then scales the
pose amplitude, the swing duration, the crab kill radius, the trauma, the sand
thrown and the pitch of the impact sample. `winding` must be cleared on blur or
the shovel stays over your head.

**The headland scatter respects `onPath()`.** Rocks and grass re-roll their
position until they're clear of the lane to the door; if you add more props
out there, ask `onPath()` first or they'll grow through the path.

**The preview browser is fragile with this scene.** It can't pointer-lock, it
throttles `requestAnimationFrame` when the pane isn't focused, and long
`javascript_tool` calls (especially ones that start the audio) will kill the
pane. Drive tests through `window.__bw`, keep calls short, and force a frame
with a screenshot before reading state.

## Conventions

- Match the existing terse style: one file, grouped by `// ---` banners,
  short helper functions, `_scratch` temp vectors reused across frames.
- Keep it dependency-free and offline (vendored three, synthesised audio,
  procedural textures). New assets go in `assets/` and must be small.
- Everything flat-shaded / low-poly / cold-blue palette; keep the retro look.

## Open ideas

Real note art for the bottle · more items and scripted events along the walk
· prop-vs-prop physics · persistent dig holes · a nicer two-handed dig anim.
